Run the amelioration_2019-12-14.bat as Administrator

Once opened, run option 1 Pre-Amelioration from the main menu. This may take several minutes to complete.

The script will likely generate errors; this is fine, it is just unable to remove some of the built-in apps with PowerShell.

Run option 3: User Permissions, which will open the netplwiz GUI for configuring Windows user permissions:
Reset password for Administrator account
Double click user account, go to the Group Membership tab and select Standard User
Click OK when finished. You will be asked to sign out, click Yes.
