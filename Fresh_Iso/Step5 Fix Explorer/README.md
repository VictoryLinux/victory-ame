        Modify Windows 10 Explorer
Microsoft has opted to ship an arguably very poorly designed UI, in terms of ease of access and clarity, with Windows 10. The lack of any defined contrasts and the burying of useful elements, which have been obscured by a confusing ribbon system, is especially apparent in Windows Explorer, a very frequented application.

In light of this OldNewExplorer is an excellent project to integrate.
