        Run the latest hardentools from Security Without Borders that was downloaded in Prereq script
Due to Windows 10's ongoing security fiasco and surfacing issues, not to mention AME's commitment to basic levels of security, certain functionality needs to be modified and/or accommodated for along those lines. In addition to the adjustments made by the amelioration script, Hardentools, an open-source project from Security Without Borders, provides an optimal inclusion.

Run the latest executable with administrator privileges:

Uncheck the Powershell and cmd.exe box (unless desired)
Click Harden!
Click OK when finished
