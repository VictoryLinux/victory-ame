Extracting and Installing Updates
Before further changing the operating system, we recommend installing Microsoftâ€™s security updates. Both the Servicing Stack Update (SSU) and Cumulative Updates are required to properly install updates. The Cumulative Update includes all updates released since the initial release. This means that only the latest Cumulative Update is required to obtain updates included in prior Cumulative Updates. The correct SSU for the Cumulative Update package can be found in the "How to get this update" section of each Cumulative Update page.
