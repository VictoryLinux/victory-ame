# victory-win

        This is a work in progress. 
        At the moment the only script available assumes you installed using the Windows 10 Ameliorated ISO.
        It then remoevs some thing, and adds some things.

        You will need Git:
                choco install git -y
                cd C:\
                git clone https://github.com/VictoryLinux/victory-win

        The Short Way
                Go to C:\victory-win and Run:
                Post_AME_Install.lnk
                or
                Post_Fresh_Install.lnk (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
                as Administrator
        
        
        

        The Long Way
    
                cd C:\
                git clone https://github.com/VictoryLinux/victory-win
                cd \victory-win\AME_Iso\
                .\Victory-win.ps1
